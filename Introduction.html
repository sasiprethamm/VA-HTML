    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a degree in Bachelor's in technology with specialization in Computer Science and Engineering from R.V.R&J.C College of Engineering.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h2>Face Identification with Deep Learning and Filter Algorithm.</h2>
    <p>Although significant advances have been made recently in the field of face recognition, these have some limitations, especially when faces are in different poses or have different levels of illumination, or when the face is blurred. In this study, we present a system that can directly identify an individual under all conditions by extracting the most important features and using them to identify a person. Our method uses a deep convolutional network that is trained to extract the most important features. A filter is then used to select the most significant of these features by finding features greater than zero, storing their indices, and comparing the features of other identities with the same indices as the original image. Finally, the selected features of each identity in the dataset are subtracted from features of the original image to find the minimum number that refers to that identity. This method gives good results, as we only extract the most important features using the filter to recognize the face in different poses. We achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only half of the 128 bytes per face. The system has an accuracy of 99.7% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset and 94.02% on YouTube Faces DB</p>
    <h2>Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Ensemble Methods</h2>
    <p2>The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this work, we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. By using those properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on 4 real world datasets. Experimental evaluation confirms the superior performance of our proposed ensemble learner approach in comparison to individual learners</p>
